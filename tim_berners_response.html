Tim Berners Lee writes about the development of the WWW in his article The World-Wide Web and also discusses its advantages to contemporary networks such as WAIS and Gopher. <br>

In the early days of the internet, accessing data from another server required logging in and downloading the page. It worked, but finding the data was difficult. <br>
Lee suggested an internet that allowed users to search for the data using an engine that indexed all the data available to them. Then, when the user wished to explore <br>
that information, they would use a standardized protocol, the HTTP, to link to that piece of information, download it, and view it in a browser. <br>

This is an incredible development in web technologies because it standardized the way information is sent around. The user is not responsible for manually searching, <br>
downloading and viewing data anymore, it is compiled and the sending part is automated. In addition, with hyper linking, data can be easily linked to other associated data.<br> 
Finally, having a browser enriches the web experience with images, sound and more fun things. The web is not just for school anymore, it is a thing you can do at home for fun. <br>
