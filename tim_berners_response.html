Tim Berners Lee writes about the development of the WWW in his article The World-Wide Web and also discusses its advantages to contemporary networks such as WAIS and Gopher. 

In the early days of the internet, accessing data from another server required logging in and downloading the page. It worked, but finding the data was difficult. Lee suggested an internet that allowed users to search for the data using an engine that indexed all the data available to them. Then, when the user wished to explore that information, they would use a standardized protocol, the HTTP, to link to that piece of information, download it, and view it in a browser. 

This is an incredible development in web technologies because it standardized the way information is sent around. The user is not responsible for manually searching, downloading and viewing data anymore, it is compiled and the sending part is automated. In addition, with hyper linking, data can be easily linked to other associated data. Finally, having a browser enriches the web experience with images, sound and more fun things. The web is not just for school anymore, it is a thing you can do at home for fun.
