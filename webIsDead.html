	<h2>
	The two articles we read both proclaim that the "web is dead", but the internet lives on. It's kind of strange to think that the web<br> 
	can be dead but the internet lives, as we both think that they are synonymous, but the articles are trying to make a different assertion. <br>
	The articles claim that the original idea of the web, the idea that computers can talk to other computers and link to each other via HTTP, is <br>
	dead and replaced by closed communities of people working and consuming and hardly moving between each other. Also, the introduction of <br>
	proprietary APIs have killed the idea of free open internet. <br><br>
	
	The first claim the articles make is that the web is not a flat web anymore, but rather a stratified world in which people congregate into <br>
	certain locations and never leave. Essentially, little villages have popped up in the internet that companies have made, promising information <br>
	as long as the users who visit the site don't leave and open up their personal information to them. This is apparently saddening to the writers,<br>
	who say that the original idea of the web is dead. I don't agree with this assertion. I feel like its amazing that these communities spring up. <br>
	The companies set up the communities, but being able to find the information that you want more easier makes the internet a better place. I really <br>
	believe that the old days of not being able to easily find people who think like you were not a fun place to be, because it caused internet interactions<br>
	to be very risky as you could find a person who vehemently disagreed with you. These days, with these new communities, the web is simply a more interesting,<br>
	user friendly place. </h2>
